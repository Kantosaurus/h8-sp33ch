## 1. Introduction of Our Best Performing Model

### Ensemble Classifier: Weighted Average Approach

Our best performing model is a **Weighted Average Ensemble Classifier** that intelligently combines predictions from the top 5 individual models. This meta-learning approach achieved **73.35% accuracy**, surpassing all individual models.

#### How It Works

**Core Concept:**
The ensemble classifier operates on the principle that combining diverse high-performing models can capture different aspects of the classification problem, leading to more robust and accurate predictions.

**Architecture:**
```
Input Text → [TF-IDF Vectorization] → 
[Model 1: Extra Trees] → Prediction₁ × Weight₁
[Model 2: CatBoost]   → Prediction₂ × Weight₂
[Model 3: Ridge]      → Prediction₃ × Weight₃
[Model 4: LDA]        → Prediction₄ × Weight₄
[Model 5: LightGBM]   → Prediction₅ × Weight₅
                      ↓
                [Weighted Average] → Final Prediction
```

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
Final_Prediction = Σ(wᵢ × pᵢ) where:
- wᵢ = normalized weight for model i (based on F1 score)
- pᵢ = probability prediction from model i
- Σwᵢ = 1 (weights sum to 1)
```

**Selected Models and Their Contributions:**
1. **Extra Trees (20.60% weight)**: Provides robust tree-based predictions with extra randomization
2. **CatBoost (19.90% weight)**: Contributes gradient boosting expertise with categorical handling
3. **Ridge Classifier (20.17% weight)**: Adds fast linear classification with regularization
4. **LDA (19.98% weight)**: Brings probabilistic dimensionality reduction insights
5. **LightGBM (19.35% weight)**: Contributes efficient gradient boosting with leaf-wise growth

**Why This Ensemble Works:**
- **Model Diversity**: Combines different algorithmic families (tree-based, linear, probabilistic)
- **Error Cancellation**: Individual model weaknesses are offset by others' strengths
- **Wisdom of Crowds**: Multiple perspectives on the same problem reduce overfitting
- **Performance-Based Weighting**: Better models have more influence on final decisions

## 2. Model Tuning Journey and Parameter Optimization

### 2.1 Systematic Tuning Approach

Our tuning methodology followed a structured approach:

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Started with default parameters
2. **Individual Optimization**: Tuned each model separately
3. **Cross-validation**: Used 5-fold stratified CV for robust evaluation
4. **Ensemble Construction**: Selected and weighted best performers
